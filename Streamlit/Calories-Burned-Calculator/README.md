# Calories Burned Prediction App

This project is a **Calories Burned Calculator** built using a machine learning model and deployed with **Streamlit**. It uses a trained `RandomForestRegressor` model to predict the number of calories burned during a workout based on features like gender, age, height, weight, workout duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The dataset used contains 15,000 fitness records and was preprocessed using `pandas` and `sklearn`. After training the model and achieving a high RÂ² score (~0.998), the model was saved using `pickle`. The Streamlit web app allows users to input their workout and body metrics, and receive real-time predictions on calories burned. This app provides a simple, interactive interface and can be easily deployed for health or fitness tracking solutions.
