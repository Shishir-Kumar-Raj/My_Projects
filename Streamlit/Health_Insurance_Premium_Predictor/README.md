# Health Insurance Premium Predictor

This project is a **Health Insurance Premium Predictor** web application built using **Streamlit**, which leverages a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to estimate the cost of an individual's health insurance premium based on demographic and lifestyle details. The app provides an intuitive interface where users can navigate between an "About" section and a "Predict" section using a sidebar. The "About" section briefly introduces the application along with a relevant image, while the "Predict" section prompts users to input their age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. Based on these inputs, the app preprocesses the data to match the format of the training dataset and then uses a trained Random Forest model to predict the insurance charges. The dataset used, `insurance.csv`, is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables such as gender, smoking status, and region into numerical values. The model is trained directly within the app, although in a production environment it is recommended to pre-train and save the model for efficiency. The final prediction is displayed in a user-friendly format with a clearly highlighted premium value. This application serves as a practical example of deploying a machine learning model with a simple and accessible frontend using Streamlit.
